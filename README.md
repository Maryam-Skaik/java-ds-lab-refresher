# 🚀 Java Data Structures Lab – Java Refresher Module

This repository contains all code files used in the Java Refresher lecture for the Data Structures Lab.
The goal of this module is to provide a fast, clear, and practical review of the Java topics required before starting Data Structures.

## 📌 Module Overview

This refresher covers the essential Java foundations needed for Data Structures:

- Java basics
- Arrays and Strings
- Classes and Objects
- Encapsulation and OOP principles
- Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Interfaces
- Generics
- Exceptions

The examples are short, practical, and directly linked to concepts used later in Data Structures (such as Node(T), access control, recursion, etc.).
